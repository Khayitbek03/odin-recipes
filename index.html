    <p>When most people think of Uzbekistan their minds immediately go to the awe-inspiring Islamic architecture of the Registan in Samarkand, the towering Kalyan Minaret of Bukhara, or the ancient walled city of Khiva. What you donâ€™t hear much about is food in Uzbekistan.

        In fact, when we first arrived we really had little to no idea what we would be eating during our 3 weeks in the country. We quickly learned that traditional Uzbek food can be quite delicious with influences from all over Asia and the Middle East.
        
        Uzbekistan shares much of its culinary tradition with Turkey as well as serving up a wide number of noodle and dumpling dishes that bear a close resemblance to their counterparts in China, Nepal, and other Eastern Asian countries.</p>
